# How to develop a software application

This repo contains code from a tutorial series called "How to Develop a Software Application" on my YouTube channel: [Tips & Tricks for Programming](https://www.youtube.com/@RoozbehShad).

If you follow the videos, you will find that I have shared with you some of my valuable experiences that I have gained throughout my career. Some, but not all, of the topics covered in the videos are as follows:

- Reverse engineering an existing database using EF Core Code First method
- Multi-Layered (n-tier) software architectural pattern
- Software design patterns such as Domain Model, Service Layer, Dependency Injection
- Consuming REST API from Blazor WebAssembly
- Creating a Generic and Reusable Data Grid Component in Blazor
- Creating a Fully Functional Pagination Component

**Note:** After uploading a new video, I will update this repo with code from the video.

## Links for the tutorial videos

For ease of finding and quick access to the videos, I have included their links in the table below. When a new video is uploaded, the table will be updated with the title, link and release date of that video.
